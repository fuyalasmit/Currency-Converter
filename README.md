# Currency Converter

This is a simple, responsive **Currency Converter** application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to convert between various currencies by fetching the latest exchange rates via an external API. This project was developed as part of my web development learning journey, with a focus on **fetch API** usage and asynchronous JavaScript.

## Features
- **Real-time currency conversion**: Converts between currencies with live exchange rates.
- **Automatic flag updates**: Updates the flags based on selected currencies.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the web page.
- **CSS** for styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and data fetching.


## How It Works
1. Enter an amount in the input box.
2. Select the currencies you want to convert from and to.
3. The application fetches the latest exchange rate from the **ExchangeRate-API**.
4. The converted amount is displayed with the appropriate currency flags.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fuyalasmit/Currency-Converter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Currency-Converter
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
