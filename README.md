# Currency-Converter
This is a simple currency converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of the fetch API in JavaScript to retrieve data from an external source. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in web development, specifically after grasping the concept of fetchAPI in JavaScript.

API Used: <br>
The application fetches currency exchange rate data from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). You can also explore its features and integrate it into your projects as needed.
